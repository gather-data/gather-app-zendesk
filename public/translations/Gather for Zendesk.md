Gather is a customizable admin tool for customer support teams that aggregates customer data, like charges from Stripe or order info from Shopify, and automates repetitive backend processes, like issuing refunds via Chargify or changing account information, all in a single, unified tool. This all happens in a low-code environment, so any non technical manager can build automations and data views to empower their teamâ€™s productivity.
